// Declare a main package (a package is a way to group functions, and it's made up of all the files in the same directory).

//When 3rd parties are downloaded two things will happen
//1) Go will add the quote module as a requirement

//2)go.sum file for use in authenticating the module
// When the go command downloads a module zip file or go.mod file into the module cache, it computes a cryptographic hash and compares it with a known value to verify the file hasnâ€™t changed since it was first downloaded. 
// The go command reports a security error if a downloaded file does not have the correct hash.



// go run main.go To run file in cmd
